# The Draconem

Mid-sized submarine designed for use in a vanilla playthrough, either alone or with a group.

## Features

Twin-engine design that drains considerable power, which rewards captains and crew with fast and responsive movement as long as battery reserves and the nuclear reactor are able to handle the load.

Comes stock with two coilguns, a railgun, and one empty hardpoint.

Capable of reaching speeds approaching 30km/h when at full throttle, though this should be used sparingly, as it won't handle it for long.

Large ballasts stationed on the fore and aft mean independent operation of both sides, allowing for crews to manage even in dire situations without sinking at the drop of a hat.

These larger ballasts also mean the ship is capable of ascending and
diving at considerable rates.

This submarine is capable of reaching mid to late game.

## Cost

Default price is 22,500 Europan Marks, making this one of the more
expensive submarines you can buy.<hr>

### Installation

Download the last stable release from [Github](https://github.com/Peliex/Draconem/releases/tag/stable) or the [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2869111484)

#### Advanced installation

Download the source code and run `createlinks.bat`, this uses a symbolic link to place the **src** folder inside **"Barotrauma/LocalMods/draconem"**, you will need to grant administrator permission unless run from a command line.

Due to the nature of symlinks in program files, this method is not recommended.
